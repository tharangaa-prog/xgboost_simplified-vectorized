# XGBoostTreeApproximator
This project implements a method that converts a trained XGBoost into a single decision tree.
At this stage, this package is ideal for binary classification challenges.
It can be applied for challenges with a few classes (2-3) but is not recommended for numerous classes, at least for the current implementation.
Please see the included .ipynb file for further explanations of the API.
